# TurtleCosmetics
A lib mod/cosmetic mod for ComputerCraft Turtles

This client side mod permits adding new turtle overlays via config and resourcepacks

```toml

["Client Side Configs for Turtle Cosmetics"]
	#Paths for resource locations (namespace:resource)
	resources = ["computercraft:block/turtle_elf_overlay"]
	#Labels for the overlays (has to be same size as the paths)
	label = ["elf"]

```

by adding the elf label on a turtle it gets the elf overlay, overlays can be stacked, by adding in the label the keywords for the overlay, this mod doesn't contain any overlays by itself
